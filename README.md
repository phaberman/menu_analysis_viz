# Menu Analysis Vizualizations

This is a simple project that takes an excel file with pre-filled in Menu information and outputs the needed plotly scatter plots.

- The x-axis contains the sales mix %, e.g. "Popularity"
- The y-axis contains the contribtion margin (menu price - portion cost), e.g. "Profitability"
